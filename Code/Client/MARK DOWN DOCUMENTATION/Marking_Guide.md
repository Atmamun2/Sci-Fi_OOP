# Part B: Mechatronics Enhancement - Marking Criteria & Requirements

## Overview
**Total Marks:** 25  
**Type:** Group Project (Teams of 3)  
**Submission:** ZIP file with code, visual evidence, and README.md  

---

## B1. Mechatronic Assembly & Component Validation (10 marks)
**Primary Outcome:** SE-11-03

### Requirements:

#### Assembly Craftsmanship & Visual Proof (5 marks)
- Robot correctly assembled with neat wiring and secure mechanical connections
- **Evidence:** 2-3 clear, well-lit photos from different angles:
  - Top-down view
  - Side view focusing on wiring
  - Additional angle showing overall construction

#### Component Test Bench Video (5 marks)
- **Duration:** Maximum 60 seconds
- **Must demonstrate BOTH:**
  1. **Actuator Test** - Simple script showing key actuator function
     - Examples: wheels spinning forward for 2 seconds, servo arm sweeping
  2. **Sensor Test** - Simple script reading live sensor data to console
     - Examples: ultrasonic distance values changing as hand moves closer

### Performance Levels:
| Level | Score | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Extensive** | 9-10 | Expert assembly with clean wiring, high-quality photos, clear test video showing both components working robustly |
| **Thorough** | 7-8 | Correct and functional assembly with minor neatness issues, test video shows both components but one may be less clear |
| **Sound** | 5-6 | Functional assembly, photos provided, test video shows at least one component working correctly |
| **Basic** | 3-4 | Complete but messy/fragile assembly, test video missing or fails to clearly demonstrate components |
| **Elementary** | 1-2 | Incomplete or incorrect assembly, visual evidence missing or very poor quality |

## B2. Software Implementation & Enhancement (10 marks)
**Outcomes:** SE-11-02, SE-11-07, SE-11-08

### Requirements:

#### Feature Implementation (4 marks)
- Code successfully and reliably implements the proposed enhancement
- Directly controls hardware to achieve team's stated goal
- Enhancement works consistently and as intended

#### Code Quality & Structure (3 marks)
- Well-structured, modular, and readable code
- Meaningful variable names and clear logic
- Effective integration with any original starter code

#### Safe & Robust Coding (3 marks)
- **Error Handling:** `try...except` blocks for sensor readings
- **Resource Cleanup:** `finally` blocks for proper resource management
- **Safety Logic:** Code prevents hardware from entering unsafe states
- **Defensive Programming:** Handles unexpected inputs/conditions

### Performance Levels:
| Level | Score | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Extensive** | 9-10 | Elegant, efficient, robust code with excellent safe coding practices and clear structure |
| **Thorough** | 7-8 | Code works well, good structure, includes some safe coding practices but could be improved |
| **Sound** | 5-6 | Core feature implemented but may be unreliable, adequate structure, minimal safe coding |
| **Basic** | 3-4 | Partial implementation, difficult to read, lacks structure, minor modification of starter code |
| **Elementary** | 1-2 | Code doesn't work or shows minimal original effort |

## B3. Final System Demonstration (5 marks)
**Outcome:** SE-11-06

### Requirements:

#### Video Demonstration
- **Duration:** 1-2 minutes
- **Content:** Clear demonstration of robot successfully performing the new feature
- **Key Requirement:** Must clearly show cause-and-effect relationship between environmental stimulus (or command) and robot's programmed response
- **Quality:** Concise, engaging, and easy to understand

### Performance Levels:
| Level | Score | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Extensive** | 5 | Engaging, clear, concise video compellingly showing enhancement working successfully with unmistakable cause-and-effect |
| **Thorough** | 4 | Video clearly shows enhancement working but may be unclear, too long, or poorly framed |
| **Sound** | 3 | Shows enhancement attempt but only works partially or unreliably |
| **Basic** | 2 | Video submitted but very difficult to understand what's happening or feature doesn't work |
| **Elementary** | 1 | Very poor quality video or doesn't show intended enhancement |
