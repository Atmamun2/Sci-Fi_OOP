# Hexapod Robot Kit - Project Improvements

## Important Note: Client-Side Improvements
**All significant changes and improvements have been made within the `Client` folder.** The rest of the project remains in its original state.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Camera Enhancement
- Implemented improved camera functionality for better visual feedback
- Enhanced image processing for more accurate object detection
- Optimized camera performance for smoother video streaming

**CAMERA ENHANCEMENT CODE CAN BE FOUND IN `src/utils/camera_recorder.py`, and `src/main.py` (LINES 1430-1460)**

### 2. Code Refactoring
- Restructured the codebase following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Improved code organization and modularity
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Added comprehensive code documentation

## Project Structure
The client code is organized as follows:
- `src/` - Main source code
  - `config/` - Configuration files
  - `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
  - `components/` - Modular components
- `logs/` - Log files
- `visual_evidence/` - Contains demonstration videos and screenshots 

For any queries about the organisation of files, see `code/client/README.md`

## Visual Evidence
Please refer to the `visual_evidence` folder for:
- Demonstration videos of the improved functionality
- Screenshots of the enhanced interface
- Before/after comparisons of the camera improvements
